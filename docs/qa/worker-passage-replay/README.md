# Reproducible worker passage at a recovery boundary

The saved Sabana/Mapungubwe/712 state is from day 4, time 75, immediately before a worker/mobile-body recovery. It was captured at an ordinary campaign tick boundary with the production Wild Engine WASM SHA-256 `0d2901425c9d16fa38cdafc916680d3086c1b18f6730a0bfc584f6b1315d817d`. The [state](sabana-712-day4-before.json) has SHA-256 `cf76f7161b270981397c1e9ef069e033978dc595cb88fa08d8b78715ac1ff7cc`.

Rebuilding the native session from this save and advancing one simulated second produces `ActorMobileCollisionRecovery` for `worker-1755` at elapsed time `1875.699999999157`, position `(92.12030760842035, 0.18023842346321228)`. The same actor, instant and position occur in the uninterrupted campaign. Two fresh replays yield identical serialized-state SHA-256 `f52b1e4ab604e7ca2585873659bc1a995b469eb2c341e0d9c7e6fd3ed8b339c1`.

At the event, `worker-1762` blocks the next half-metre. The actor is walking toward task `native-point-task-1857`; the blocking worker is also walking, on a crossing route. The recovery then temporarily ignores mobile-body clearance. This fixture is a short, deterministic target for a physically safe passing or yielding solution, not an assertion that the recovery is correct.

To regenerate the frozen state from the native campaign:

```powershell
$env:WG_WORKER_CAPTURE_DAY='4'
$env:WG_WORKER_CAPTURE_TIME='74.5'
$env:WG_WORKER_CAPTURE_OUTPUT='test-results/worker-passage-day4-before.json'
node tools/experiments/probe-worker-overlaps.mjs 4 712 good sabana mapungubwe wild-engine
```

The profile script advances simulation without replaying the virtual player's commands between campaign ticks. Its **whole-state** hash after the tick therefore differs from the uninterrupted campaign (which also plants and casts a spell during that interval); the collision event itself matches. Compare candidate collision fixes on this fixture first, then on full 9- and 14-night campaigns with the same economic policy. No production movement or balance code changes here.
